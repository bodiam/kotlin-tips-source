Kotlin allows classes to be extended using https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html[Extension Functions]. These Extension Functions can also be used for extending operators if they are declared with the `operator` keyword.

An example of such an Extension Function can be seen below, to draw a repeated set of characters.

[source,kotlin]
----
operator fun Int.times(text: CharSequence): CharSequence {
    val result = StringBuilder()

    for (i in 1..this) {
        result.append(text)
    }

    return result.toString()
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val line = 10 * "x"

    println(line)
}
----

Running the script results in the output of a line consisting of x characters:

----
xxxxxxxxxx
