Creating new Strings in any JVM language is often slow and memory extensive. To prevent this, StringBuilders are introduced. To use them in Koltin, Kotlin introduced the `https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.text/build-string.html[buildString]` method. This is especially helpful when building bigger Strings.

[source,kotlin]
----
val x = buildString {
    append("Lucky numbers: ")
    for (i in 1..10) {
        append("${(Math.random() * 100).toInt()}, ")
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println(x)
}
----

Output:

[source]
----
Lucky numbers: 37, 92, 47, 34, 33, 92, 98, 82, 51, 5,

Created with Kotlin 1.0.5-2
